0.05	28 December 2003
	Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

0.04	25 August 2003
	Found Symbol::delete_package for zapping modules from memory.  Seems
	to be much more reliable than my own little method.  Now uses that
	and zaps Symbol from memory if it wasn't loaded already.

0.03	13 August 2003
	Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated the copyright info.  Made sure
	the test-suite runs under strict and warnings.  Added a message
	about warnings that may occur from AutoLoader.

0.02	29 July 2002
	Added an actual test-suite.

	Added second example for inclusion in modules.

	Adapted "import" so that it returns the modules that were not yet
	marked to be saved in threads.

	Fixed some documentation nits.

0.01	28 July 2002
	First version of Thread::Needs.
